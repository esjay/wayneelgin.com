                                    <h1>Ratings don't mean what you think they mean</h1>
                    <p>NewTeeVee&rsquo;s <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2012/05/30/how-netflix-really-did-save-the-cw/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+newteevee+%28GigaOM%3A+Video%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">write up of the CW/Netflix partnership</a> that is funding new, original content on the relatively flailing network reminded me of the <a href="http://www.nerdist.com/2012/05/nerdist-podcast-tina-fey/">Tina Fey-Nerdist interview</a> from a couple of months ago. In it, Tina discussed the way that shows live and die based upon ratings, and made the point that the digital viewers are completely disregarded purposefully. That is, only the old-timey Nielsen ratings matter to the life of a show on a national network because that is where advertisers focus their attention. A show can have a significant cultural impact and can even be bringing in great numbers online, but may suck in the Nielsen ratings (perhaps because their content predetermines their audience) and eventually will be cancelled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understandable why this is the case, but there is an obvious apparent disconnect between this type of dependency and reality, if you spend any amount of time at all watching non-network TV. News people (many of whom are also playing that old ratings game) tend to focus on the ratings numbers of shows and underreport the productions with the lowest ratings numbers. Because news = buzz to producers, this cycle spirals down until shows meet their demises. It&rsquo;s great that CW is working on a cross-platform ratings system of its own, but nobody&rsquo;s really paying attention to that either.Â </p>
<p>Steam and other digital retailers have the same problem, where the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/226007/valve_wont_provide_steam_sales_data_should_we_care.html">retail sales data for video games sold</a> were the only ones that were being paid attention to for several years after Steam was released. In the meantime, the entire hardcore-game-playing population on the PC shifted out of retail stores and onto Steam for a number of good reasons. If you&rsquo;re a buyer for the local Target&rsquo;s inventory, shelf sales data is probably useful, but for gamers, we didn&rsquo;t care how many copies of Sims 3 or World of Warcraft sold. It&rsquo;s much more interesting to hear about games doing unique things or putting a new spin on familiar subject matter than to know how much you&rsquo;re similar to or different from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Back to TV: when ratings determine the future of shows, but are only partial information, you train viewers to have maintain a low investment in shows that are niche or risk having another tinge of disappointment at one more cancellation. Maybe there&rsquo;s more room for niche when the audiences refuse to be only partially represented by a shrinking segment of themselves.</p>
