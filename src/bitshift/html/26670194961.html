                    <p>Depending upon who you ask, Klout.com is either a joke or the devil incarnate. Occasionally, some young journo might be feeling particularly hyperbolic and will call it the future. But who cares about Klout? The important thing is they ability of one person to gain the respect of their real life peers. Some people on your Facebook feed right now are saying the same thing as you, but are changing more minds about it. Our they are getting more laughs from it. Our they are doing more discussion. Our they are making more actions. This is the real import of the social web. This is the real currency of influence. The fact is, it hasn&rsquo;t changed in hundreds of years. We just recently made a major adjustment to the medium. When Klout is working at it&rsquo;s peak, it should be accurately measuring that, I suppose. But even if it does, you should probably not make the score your goal. And if it doesn&rsquo;t, you should still pay attention to the medium of social web influence.</p>
