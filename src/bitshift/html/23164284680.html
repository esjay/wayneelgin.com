                                    <h1>Why is Anyone Buying Apps?</h1>

<p>Some app developers are killing it in the iPhone App Store or the Google Play Store (<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Mashable/~3/SULHgu-PRjA/">many aren&rsquo;t</a>, BTW). But the average cost of an app is a fraction of what even the most pointless of screensaver-collections-on-discs cost even 10 years ago. What happened?</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s a mix of occurrences such as the emergence of the self-publishing model in the post-dot-com-bubble world, the success of the iPhone leading to the personalization of technology, the fun of discovering a unique app that resonates with you, and the ease of sharing the things you&rsquo;re excited about with your social graph.</p>
<p>While that&rsquo;s not really all inclusive, I don&rsquo;t know anybody who attributes the mobile app space&rsquo;s success to restrictive controls and DRM over the apps themselves. Apple has controls, but Android really doesn&rsquo;t. Some developers are miffed toward Google for that, but the vast majority of their customers don&rsquo;t even know what that is and don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Why not? Because getting a marginally-valuable app legally is generally cheap enough and easy enough that trying to find a way around that pay wall seems too laborious to matter. They&rsquo;re better served when they go along with the system than when they fight against it. Making a system that inherently rewards paying customers with ease of access and use pays exponentially better than dragging people who aren&rsquo;t really your customers (even one of them) through court for settlement fees. It&rsquo;s almost certainly much easier in the short term to let the lawyers go to work, though.</p>
