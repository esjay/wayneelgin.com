                                    <h1>Digital Ownership vs. Licensure (part 2)</h1>
                    <p>This is part 2 of a 2 part post. See <a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/28491272684/digital-ownership-pt1">part 1</a>.</p>
<p>So, what is changing for the benefit of the customer? At the beginning of July, the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregvoakes/2012/07/03/european-courts-rule-in-favor-of-consumers-reselling-downloaded-games/">European Court ruled</a> that software licenses can be resold in certain cases. <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-07-12-valve-if-origin-can-make-millions-happy-too-awesome">Valve (and Steam) said</a> they they are aware of the ruling, but aren&rsquo;t planning on changing anything just yet. That might seem odd, but remember the ruling wasn&rsquo;t about games, so it may be a canary in the digital distribution coal mine, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean anybody needs to change strategies just yet.</p>
<p>Current Impulse-owner <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/GameStop-Oracle-UsedSoft-Pre-Owned-Product-Key,16484.html#xtor=RSS-1813">Gamestop hints</a> that they are considering pre-owned digital sales, which fits with their brand&rsquo;s trade-in legacy perfectly. That could be a great way to distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack and link back to the core principles of Impulse founder Stardock&rsquo;s and its <a href="http://www.gamersbillofrights.org/">Gamers Bill of Rights</a>. I first thought that this might be a possibility after seeing the <a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/23478234555/steam-me-up">Steam Wallet/Gamestop tie in</a>. It seems much more evolutionary in that context. </p>
<p>But is transferring ownership always going to be a good thing for the customer? I tend to think that the current set up is more of a two-way street. While customers cannot transfer ownership, we also are enjoying a lower initial cost of ownership for many games. This is especially true as you contrast cost of development against retail pricing both today and 15 years ago. Right now, it doesn&rsquo;t cost much at all to be able to get a game straight from Steam. If a used digital game market sprung up overnight, lots of things could happen as the market attempts to adjust for that. Those games can have second, third, or fourth lives as people trade them around. There&rsquo;s less demand for the Steam&rsquo;s copy, so the temptation might be strong to create some scarcity. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speculating, but I don&rsquo;t believe it would happen for very long for most games. But a high-demand market might be able to support a $150 price for a few AAA games if they had resale. But other factors would influence that, too, such as multiplayer or co-op integration (it&rsquo;s no fun to be the only one of your gaming circle with a copy of a heavy multiplayer game) and subscription services (who cares about initial cost, if sustained cost is so high?).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d suppose that one of the most appealing solutions for most parties that might come out is one where the resale is overseen and managed by the platform. If the split is 70/20/10 to the player/publisher/platform, then even the pre-owned sale nets the company unforeseen revenue and makes it worthwhile to encourage the act. I suspect gamers will want a little more than that cut, and some publishers will demand significantly more, which means I&rsquo;m probably pretty close.</p>
<p>Soothsaying is exhausting. But, no matter how right or wrong I am, I do think this digital economic landscape is being completely redefined over the next 5 years. And I would be surprised if the complications surrounding intellectual property law don&rsquo;t spur the international economies to collude towards a more consistent approach to how we do business.</p>
