<p>I always liked the &ldquo;put your money where your mouth is&rdquo; (known now as PYMWYMI [pim-wim-ee], because I said so) approach to culture. If you can do it right, you can increase buy in (literally and figuratively) where it seems more likely to further distance yourself from your customers. An extension of the Eventful model, <a href="http://www.bringthegig.com/">Bring the Gig</a> is attempting to add the PYMWYMI into the concert and live event space. Lots of fingers are being aimed squarely at live events as the penultimate salvation from the inevitable digital race to the bottom. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s ever going to be fully that, but live events are typically much better than the digital thing they are resting upon (Barry Manilow&rsquo;s touring concert notwithstanding). </p>
<p>The premise is that you and 39 of your peers will buy a ticket for a concert that you wish to attend, and if you manage to bring 159 of your closest friends instead of 39, then the original 40 buyers get their tickets for free.</p>
<p>For some reason, this sounds better than the Living Social model, but the math is the same (3:1 pay-to-free ratio). You just need to do it at a larger scale to make it worth the local venue&rsquo;s while. </p>
<p>Historically, the traction generated by live event tools is mediocre at best. Which is odd, given that everybody seems to hate hate hate Ticketmaster. But somehow ticket hopeful StubHub has managed to quadruple the cost of a TicketMaster ticket for the same event whenever I check. </p>
<p>Jonathan Coulton, being willing to try much of what is new and experimental in the world, was the first performer to clue me into this with his <a href="http://www.bringthegig.com/salt-lake-city/jonathan-coulton/11-27-12">Salt Lake City show</a>. Coincidentally, Coulton had also introduced Eventful to me, which seems to have died off in the years following. As I said above, it&rsquo;s one thing to say, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll see that person&rdquo; and a different thing entirely to plop down the ticket price and actually pre-buy the ticket. So, the Kickstarter + Eventful model is a formula I can get behind. Whether it has enough staying power to outlast its own startup costs is another question.</p>
