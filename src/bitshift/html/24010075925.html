                                    <h1>What will Become of the Converged TV?</h1>
                    <p>Recently, I was (and still sort of am) in the market for a streaming device. I was caught between Boxee and Google TV. The problem for me, and I imagine many early-adopter consumers, is there is no one platform that has ubiquitous platform support. Options are a big deal when you&rsquo;re looking at living room devices. The only streaming platform supported by every device is Netflix, which is great for Netflix but is a terrible indicator of the state of streaming.</p>
<p>I like to rent Amazon movies to stream, but even Google TV only supports it via the built-in browser. That&rsquo;s just OK for now. Roku&rsquo;s Amazon app is much better, but of course Roku is notoriously lacking a YouTube app and a few others like Vudu. Boxee has a good browser that will support Amazon Video, too, and supports Vudu well and YouTube with a so-so app. Boxee also has your local media covered really well with the best media recognition algorithm that I&rsquo;ve witnessed to date.<br/>Google TV has the brightest app potential, however, because at least theoretically any Android app can be made a GTV app trivially. But so far, the GTV apps remain mostly unimpressive. My hope and guess is that Boxee will come over to Android and GTV will be a viable platform for me.</p>
<p>For the rest of the consumers, price is still way too high. Consider that Apple TV is selling for $100 retail while most of the other players (except Roku) are trying to make out like a streaming bandit for $200-$300 device prices. That&rsquo;s a huge leap. And that&rsquo;s why Roku has a great install base despite having a much less capable product. It&rsquo;s taken a few years to see the Revue and Boxee devices reach a price point where normal people might be compelled to to see it as a good value (BTW, I hate this race to the bottom as much as anybody, but I think if Apple is pricing their streaming product at $99, you really have to fight for $200).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not going to be surprised if some of the living room players are eliminated or consolidated in the next year. I don&rsquo;t know if Boxee can make it on devices much longer, so maybe a Plex-like presence is in their future. If so, they need to get on board the ubiquity train if they expect people to pay. I am guessing Roku will be fine because they are so inexpensive that many folks will not mind dropping $50 on a streamer for a spare room or on a whim. Xbox could have been a much bigger player in this space if Microsoft didn&rsquo;t squander their heyday (but then, isn&rsquo;t that what Microsoft always does?) Of course, Nintendo is apparently clueless about its home presence. Netflix makes more now from the Wii as a stagnating platform than Nintendo does, I&rsquo;m sure.Â </p>
<p>So, I think we&rsquo;re all expecting an Apple living room shake up this year from a reborn TV product. If that happens, all of a sudden consumer demands will be crystalized and Google and Boxee will have something to parallel and/or contrast from a feature and interface standpoint. As it is, nobody really knows how people want to interact with their boxes. Do they want a Wii-mote controller? Do they want QWERTY remotes? Do they want just a D-pad? Do they want voice controls? Do they want to use their smartphones? Do they want Kinect? Apple will probably tell consumers what they want and the rest of the devices will adapt (and subsequently have their pants sued off). Most people seem to believe that Siri will be involved in that. Talking to me TV is a tough sell for me but Apple works miracles with marketing. And we&rsquo;ll all be paying attention to the Apple sell on this one, because I think all the other companies are too exhausted to innovate.</p>
