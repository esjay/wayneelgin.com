                                    <h1>Digital Ownership vs. Licensure (part 1)</h1>
                    <p>This is part 1 of a 2 part post. See <a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/28491350896/digital-ownership-pt2">part 2</a>.</p>
<p>The holy grail of digital ownership is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine">first sale doctrine</a>. Though it&rsquo;s something very innocuous in analog life, consumers generally wish for a way to have a real flow-through for our digital goods. This week comes <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregvoakes/2012/07/03/european-courts-rule-in-favor-of-consumers-reselling-downloaded-games/">news that there is a good chance</a> that we&rsquo;ll soon see a more customer-advantaged digital world where we can take advantage of our licensed (read &ldquo;owned&rdquo;) items.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about, when you pay for a digital thing, you are obtaining a copy of that thing along with a license that dictates under which terms you may use it. Well, many of the laws that we built our commerce upon were written with the assumption that any copy of an artistic or intellectual work would also be tied to a physical good. So, even though the act of copying works was cheap, it still was somewhat cost prohibitive and it required some amount of the copier&rsquo;s time to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the Supreme Court <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbs-Merrill_Co._v._Straus">ruled against the publisher</a> who tried to enforce a notice in its books that any sale of the book under $1.00 constituted infringement of its copyright.</p>
<p>Of course, digital copying makes all of those assumptions about the physical nature of copies irrelevant. Since it&rsquo;s so trivial to make a copy of a digital item and preserve its entire quality, the first sale doctrine has been consistently unapplied to digital works. Instead, software makers have taken to fastening end user license agreements (EULAs) to the front-end of the software and requiring your full agreement to the practically illegible document before you begin your use. It&rsquo;s these EULAs that have replaced physical ownership for software like games. In the music, book, and video world, there really are no EULAs for the content, but you still do not own the work; you merely possess a copy of it.</p>
<p>And that copy is likely the most valuable copy of a work yet. Vinyl records, magnetic tapes, even optical discs have been wearing out, deteriorating, or cracking for decades. Any of those are legal to resell. Yet a flawless copy of a new song which was recorded digitally, edited digitally, and perhaps sold losslessly is legally confined to your own collection forever.</p>
<p>The reason is that when you resell your digital good, you retain the copy of it. So you would be violating both distribution and reproduction rights. This is the reason that my article &ldquo;<a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/22712088021/hoardings-rightful-place-is-in-the-cloud">Hoarding&rsquo;s Rightful Place is in the Cloud</a>&rdquo; falters in its argument, somewhat. One consistent trait of hoarders is that they maintain a significant belief that their hoarding is actually a series of small investments and they likely will have some significant value that is difficult to see amongst the glut of it. While that assertion of value is generally fallacious, there is at least a minimal amount of value for some of these items as at least scrap, if not real value to the right person at the right time.</p>
<p>Digital goods, generally, currently have none of these aspects. If resale is legally prohibited, your license generally stops with you and even a good faith effort to dispose of your extra copies does not make your act legal.</p>
