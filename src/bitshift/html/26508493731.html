                                    <h1>Declaration of Independents</h1>
                    <p>One of the most compelling arguments in favor of using record labels and their associated networks is the function of the gatekeeper that they provide. David Lowery even used it as a justification for their existence in the future music world. By filtering out the cruft, the reasoning goes, the public is saved from having to endure their shoddy work.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s a fair enough representation of the logic behind the label&rsquo;s existence, then we should ask ourselves some questions to test whether they should play a role in the future of the industry. </p>

<p>First, is our taste in music something we obtain at birth or learned by culture? This is important if we&rsquo;re going to measure how often the label brings us what we want to hear. It&rsquo;s probably a mixture of both; the rhythm and chord progressions are innate, but culture determines much more of how we think about music in general. And for most advanced cultures, those past influences were probably implanted by labels. Therefore, much of our taste is circular: we like what we know and we know what the labels have preselected us or our parents to know.</p>

<p>Second, is music able to be quantitatively better than other music. Again, outside of consistent meter and melodic progression, this is going to be a qualitative and subjective comparison. Not to be all hipsterer than thou, but A&amp;R folks don&rsquo;t necessarily have this part down, either. They are often making bets that don&rsquo;t pay off for them. That&rsquo;s one reason that YouTube and other digital venues have paid off for labels. Just like common folk, A&amp;R can more quickly and cheaply find the talent that they like so they can get started on the rest of the deal.</p>

<p>Finally, does the filtering process need to happen anymore? If the quantity of new music continues to increase (because of reduced production costs) and there&rsquo;s a lot more relative noise than signal from a subjective standpoint, the centralized, manual filtering process doesn&rsquo;t scale well. Most journalists seem to bite that social networks will make up the difference in scale but that&rsquo;s not proven to be very with music explicitly. From my data point of 1, social networks tend to push by virality first, pop second. Neither of those are very helpful to individuals. The best scaling will be because of smarter algorithms and maybe permission-based marketing by artists saying, &ldquo;If you like me, then you&rsquo;ll like this person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The net result is that there are fewer reasons for independent artists to conform and more reasons to perform. Ignore the A&amp;Rs. Find and connect with an audience that resonates and never stop finding new ways to amaze and delight them.</p>
