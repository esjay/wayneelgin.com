                    <p>Ernesto over at TorrentFreak <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/the-avengers-why-pirates-failed-to-prevent-a-box-office-record-120508/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Torrentfreak+%28Torrentfreak%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">wrote about the Avengers</a> release last weekend, which managed to eek out the most successful first box office weekend in movie history, despite a pirated version releasing a week prior to the opening. I&rsquo;m not saying the recession is &ldquo;over,&rdquo; but it gets harder to feel sorry about it every day.</p>
<p>The really interesting point he made was towards the end is that, while the US box office is not really affected by online piracy (because they&rsquo;re mutually exclusive markets), the international box office is affected. The reason for this is given that there are large release gaps between a US release and other countries.</p>
<p>I think this is reasonable, and if you&rsquo;re a mid-level manager at the movie factory, this might be some ripe, low-hanging fruit to pluck. Potentially much greater returns than trying to fruitlessly (ha!) combat piracy where there is no intersection with your revenue. Instead, work really hard to provide the superior service, even to your customers who aren&rsquo;t in your backyard, and watch how many more people will throw money at you. </p>
<p>While we can assume that a certain amount of piracy will occur, it behooves the industry to stop thinking of each instance as a lost sale and instead pro-actively acknowledge that the old model of because-I-want-to exclusivity as a scarcity/demand creator just frustrates the very customers your trying to please. I&rsquo;m sure there are some great reasons for the exclusivity windows that you&rsquo;ve set up, but how sure are you that the windows are offsetting the revenue lost from these other countries? Whose members don&rsquo;t wish you ill, they just want to join in on the fun that you&rsquo;re creating&hellip; in this moment, before it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
