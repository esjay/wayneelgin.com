                                    <h1>What Sony's Exit from the Optical Disc Drive Market Tells us About the Future of Media</h1>
                    <p>The notion of optical discs as a predominant storage medium of the future was dead before I wrote my first post on this blog. So it may seem a little obvious to everyone that companies would be throwing in the towel for their optical disc computer drives. But when <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/sony_ejects_optical_disc_drive_market">Sony is the first major company to withdraw from the PC optical drive market</a> (as of November), all of our eyebrows should raise. Why?</p>
<p>Sony was one of the first compact disc technology developers (the other being Philips) back in the 1970s, when everyone was still rocking 8-tracks or cassette tapes if you were modern. It also worked tirelessly in the subsequent 3 decades to replace its own technologies with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony#Formats_and_technologies"><em>more</em> optical formats</a>, such as DVD, minidisc, Super Audio CD, UMD, and finally Blu-Ray. The point is, you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find another player more invested in optical discs as a major business strategy for the last 35 years.</p>
<p>To be fair, Sony isn&rsquo;t abandoning Blu-Ray or consumer devices. This is all about the PC drive division. But, it&rsquo;s significant still because Sony is admitting that the optical platform isn&rsquo;t going to expand outside of the consumer relationships it has now. That means, nobody is at home writing out DVDs and certainly not Blu-Rays for family video shows; it&rsquo;s simply easier to publish it to Facebook or YouTube.</p>
<p>Naturally, Apple told everybody years ago that we didn&rsquo;t really want optical drives and sold lots of folks on the Macbook Air and the iPad. The laptops that we&rsquo;re seeing come out since then are going for lighter, slimmer profiles and that means cutting out clunky mechanisms like optical drives.</p>
<p>This all may seem troubling to physical disc collectors and especially the folks who replaced their VHSes with DVDs and hence their DVDs with Blu-Rays (hopefully you skipped HD DVDs). However, it&rsquo;s actually going to be a good thing when the market shifts away from physical discs.</p>
<p>If you look at the PC video game industry in 2008, retailers were not willing to give shelf space to the small-market PC games when there were console games to be sold. Luckily, Steam was already in a position to sell lots of different PC games at that point with no shelf space concerns to worry about. The PC game market reinvented itself without much trouble at all, and now there is a huge variety of choice and price points.</p>
<p>After the physical disc sector burns off, there will hopefully be a much more interesting digital distribution phoenix that will arise (if it looks like Ultraviolet, something went wrong). And in the mean time, get the content you want on physical disc for cheap and store it on a cheap digital platform like <a href="http://www.plexapp.com">Plex</a> for your own use.</p>
