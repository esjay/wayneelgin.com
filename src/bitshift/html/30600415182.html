                                    <h1>What's It Taking to Get Greenlit?</h1>
                    <p>The floodgates are flooding and the opinions are opining about the value of Steam Greenlight. Some clever uses have already appeared.</p>
<p>We mentioned the <a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/30184419158/gaming-steam-greenlight-with-the-green-light-bundle">Greenlight Bundle last week</a> as an interesting way to get a mass of thumbs up on some games. Since then <a href="https://twitter.com/indieroyale/status/241279329085054976">Indie Royale made a collection</a> as a way of letting people know where some of their off-Steam games are being held hostage.</p>
<p>Naturally, this being the internet, there are feelings are getting hurt. One <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/z4ult/rgaming_can_we_have_a_word_on_greenlight/">developer has taken to Reddit</a> to air his frustrations over the low quality comments which are looking at his game only as a Minecraft knock-off because of its visuals, despite not playing anything at all like Minecraft. I think the consensus that this is a result of the newness of Greenlight is close to spot on. Right now, lots of the people there are unsure what to expect to come out of Greenlight. </p>
<p>Rock, Paper, Shotgun <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/08/31/steam-greenlight-discussed/">interviewed a few indie game devs</a> and they are echoing the sentiments that some people might be viewing this as a chance to get games that they were already going to get (like Call of Duty 13: Special Green Berets or Gears of War 9: Gear Harder) but only sooner thanks to their demands. I dont&rsquo; know, I&rsquo;m just guessing. They&rsquo;re probably right that a downvote button has less of a place in this type of environment. But I think Valve doesn&rsquo;t look at their people as a bunch of anonymous users; they see them as unique customers with identities that they can attach personal data to.</p>
<p>The dust will be settling on Greenlight and some structural things will change. As more upvotes come out, we&rsquo;ll probably see an almost there section. I&rsquo;d personally rather see a money-where-your-mouth-is mechanism, as it ties in the amount you&rsquo;re willing to pay into how critical or receptive you are for a given game. It may also keep out the kids who are living allowance-to-allowance. Who knows.</p>
<p>None of this is stopping the old way from working. In fact, it gives Valve more time to assess the other games, I&rsquo;d think. So, nobody should worry that now Steam is somehow more tainted because the kids are running things. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see Half Life 3 on Greenlight ever.</p>
