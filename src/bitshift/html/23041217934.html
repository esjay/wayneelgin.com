<p>While the media production and distribution companies are busy plugging the virtual holes in the money ships they&rsquo;ve been piloting for the better part of a century, the remainder of the retail sector has been largely immune from the effects of the digital world. </p>
<p>But if the only thing that is constant in this world is change, I suspect the physical goods market will be disturbed by the meaning of the chart at the top of this post. That represents the growing consumer interest (measured by search volume) in 3D printing. It&rsquo;s already possible for people with the right equipment to print their own <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/04/05/how-a-geek-dad-and-his-3d-printer-aim-to-liberate-legos/">Lego-compatible blocks</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/20/is-printing-a-gun-the-same-as-buying-a-gun/">their own guns</a>, and (if you want to get technical) their own <a href="http://vimeo.com/29984723">houses</a>. And you thought some job sectors were in jeopardy when you saw Napster.</p>
<p>If the lobbying groups can be ignored for long enough, this could be a very ripe market for revolution. The technology will only get more consistent, easier to use, and cheaper over time. So many products go from being something shipped to something transmitted and assembled (until the assembly becomes automated).</p>
<p>What happens when laws are created to protect authored works, but physical goods were always presumed to be safe. Imagine all the laws that will be proposed, the goods that will be infringed, and the futility of the fights! Because, in the end, people will seek the easiest path for them. It took the music industry essentially 10 years to get on board the digital distribution train, but they&rsquo;re finally finding ways to work within that system versus against it. Let&rsquo;s hope the physical goods groups don&rsquo;t have to wait a decade to learn the same lessons.</p>
<p>Update: As if on cue, today TechCrunch posted a <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/62gmcwE-nAE/">story</a> that 70% of users pay &ldquo;little or nothing&rdquo; for mobile apps. The thing that jumped out at me, though, is that 2 out of 3 users said they&rsquo;d paid for a mobile app. That&rsquo;s more than I had thought. That means that for every 10 users who are experiencing your demo app for the first time, 6 of them are just one-tap away from giving you their money if you amaze them. That&rsquo;s an impulse ratio that nationwide brands spend a lot of money to achieve.  </p>
