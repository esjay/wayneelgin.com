<p>Netflix just put up <a href="http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/">Indie Game: The Movie</a>, which I had been meaning to watch since it was <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/207080">released on Steam</a>. Here are some thoughts, but if you like anything about this blog, you should just go ahead and see it (<a href="https://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Indie_Game_The_Movie/70229918?trkid=438403">on Netflix here</a>).</p>
<p>First of all, the documentary is not exactly full of mirth and cheer. In fact, it&rsquo;s a kind of depressing tale. It follows the stories of both <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/">Team Meat</a> (of Super Meat Boy fame) and <a href="http://polytroncorporation.com/61-2">Phil Fish</a> (of Fez fame) in parallel as they strain themselves to reach their respective release deadlines. It also has sound bites from Jonathan Blow (of Braid), Ron Carmel (of World of Goo), and others, but the bulk of it features SMB and Fez.</p>
<p>While the romance of game developing is used as a hook early on with some callbacks throughout, the creators are shown over the months of development spiralling outwards in their own ways. Edmund McMillen is definitely the most mentally stable of the three, but he and his wife both seem very emotional around the release of Super Meat Boy.</p>
<p>Part of developing anything successfully is being too dumb to know better, so peeking behind the indie-game development curtain like this feels like it&rsquo;s a warning sign to kids with aspirations of glory and the easy life. But in the end, despite the horrendous setbacks and the terrible way that Microsoft interacts with its indie community (more on that in a later post), all the trouble and hard work seems to be worth it (spoiler alert!).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend this as good watching for indie game fans, but also I feel that it&rsquo;s education for the uninitiated as to what the indie game community means. For people who remain on the fence about whether or not the numerousÂ <a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/23607506287/steam-sales-and-indie-bundles-prevent-more-piracy-than">indie game bundles provide real value</a> or for those who confuse indie games with the $2 game bin at Walmart, this should be an eye-opening experience.</p>
