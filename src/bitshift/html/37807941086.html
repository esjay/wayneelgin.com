                                    <h1>What Redbox's Move into Instant Tells Us About the Shifting Attitude of Movie Publishers</h1>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s been a nice week for online video. A few days ago, Netflix confirmed that it was replacing Disney Movies Online as the instant distributor for Disney (which will probably in turn spark some changes to their traditional fee structure). And today, Redbox and Verizon popped up in the news again to remind us that they have an online video venture going. Oh, and hey, it&rsquo;s coming this month.</p>
<p>When the Redbox/Verizon venture was first announced, I mostly dismissed it as a probable value-add for existing Verizon customers. I guess EPIX hate for cord-cutters trained me to do that. However, it&rsquo;s $8 a month and looks to be the real deal. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if some value-add components pop up soon, though.Â </p>
<p>And the biggest surprise to me is the relationship Redbox Instant has with EPIX. Given the Hulu for new-ish movies nature of EPIX, this reminds me a lot of the faded relationship of Netflix + Starz from a few years ago.</p>
<p>Hopefully there will be minimum overlap between Redbox and Netflix. The 4 free DVDs a month is a good start, but feels like Redbox is just having trouble moving on. In reality, the only reason why Redbox has been a success so far is because of the hesitance of the movie publishers to move out of the theater and into the home.</p>
<p>With the Redbox deal, we&rsquo;re starting to see the baby steps of those publishers into the cloud. But we&rsquo;re probably never going to get our slam dunk. The MPAA have had a lot of time to watch the music industry&rsquo;s fallout (Napster) and eventual reunion (iTunes) with the internet. With iTunes signaling the aforementioned slam dunk.</p>
<p>But the movies have been slowly wading down through the wake of the MP3 revolution. Still refusing to allow DRM to be removed (because what would happen if millions of people pirated movies every day?&hellip;), but not giving any one company the majority stake in distributing everything. By that I&rsquo;m not meaning giving exclusive distribution rights. But, rather, that the MPAA currently has some business interest in making online videos as confusing for customers as possible. It makes it less valuable to be any one middle man and it makes it somewhat appealing for the customer to just purchase the physical movie outright because it&rsquo;s not reliant upon your monthly fees and will not expire if a contract dissolves.</p>
<p>So, this is good news. But we have a ways to go until we reach the DRM-free, ubiquitous movie utopia that we&rsquo;re hoping for.</p>
