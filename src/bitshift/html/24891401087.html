<p>For the first time that I can recall, Netflix has announced which specific <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2012/06/superhero-summer.html">big-name movies</a> are slated to appear upon its service a couple of months in advance. We&rsquo;ve seen some announcements in the past about entire blocks of content and those might include some mentions of movies. But this feels different.Â </p>
<p>While the Netflix blog has never quite been the typical PR-laden barrage of every little change the company makes, I think it&rsquo;s read by a vocal minority of Netflix customers (which is a larger contingent than we probably realize). My hope is that it is a harbinger of a more concerted effort to arm the Netflix audience with enough knowledge of pending contracts to make informed decisions of alternative media acquisitions. And maybe even to give us something to look forward to.</p>
