                                    <h1>Your Greatest Competitor</h1>
                    <p>The chief fear of companies staring down the barrel of digital distribution is that, once the trigger is pulled, their customers will devalue their content and expect to pay less for it.</p>
<p>This is, of course, true. I can&rsquo;t undo the years of buying, for instance, movies at $20 only to watch them once or an album for $16 to listen to one song. But I also didn&rsquo;t really have any other options. </p>
<p>In the digital world, sliced-and-diced à la carte offerings aren&rsquo;t just doable, they&rsquo;re plain expected. And once that door has been opened, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to go back to buying 12 songs I don&rsquo;t like to get 1 that I do.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the content producer is competing against himself: same content with different offerings servicing different customers. To the trading-analog-dollars-for-digital-dimes executives, this somehow is horrifying. Of course, for the customers, it&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve always dreamed. How many people have you heard say they&rsquo;d love to just select the cable channels they want and pay only for those? While it&rsquo;s not advantageous to the producers on a per unit basis, there is also going to be an increased market for the à la carte model with a nearly zero distribution cost increase.</p>
<p>The alternative, though, is basically piracy. And this is what motivates the supply forward. As demonized as intellectual pirates are, media prices would <em>never</em> have dropped so significantly in their absence.</p>
