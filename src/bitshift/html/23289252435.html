                                    <h1>Free to Pay</h1>
                    <p>The other day, Cliffski and Nicholas Lovell had a <a href="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2012/05/16/free-or-not-free-the-debate/">spirited debate</a> about the merits of free-to-play versus paid games. In the past, Cliffski (of Gratuitous Space Battles fame) has been notoriously <a href="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2012/03/02/pricing-for-gratuitous-tank-battles/">critical</a> about the <a href="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2011/05/08/indie-game-pricing-pressures/">high amount of pressure</a> indie developers have to drop prices of their games. The debate is worth your time, so you should read it now.</p>
<p>The only reason why free-to-play is even an option for developers or why indie games can be sold for less than a cup of coffee and still feed a developer at the other end is the <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/12/the-erosion-in-the-paid-media-pyramid.html">marginal cost for digital platforms is practically zero</a>. So what does that mean for the independent games going forward?</p>
<p>Nicholas argues that any new businesses publishing games need to assume that consumers are engaging with free-to-play games already and that they have certain expectations associated with that. The comments on that article indicate a lot of people are leaping from that to him saying that all future games should be free to play. I didn&rsquo;t infer that. Nicholas summed up the opposing comments well:</p>
<blockquote>In many ways, I feel that this argument, generally, often ends up as “the type of games that I like will be made less often under the F2P model, and that is bad”. I think that the first statement may be true. I don’t agree with the second.</blockquote>
<p>The digital market is big; HUGE, even. It&rsquo;s a capitalist&rsquo;s dream, largely because it&rsquo;s the least regulated market in the universe. So, the peaceful answer to the debate is that there is plenty of room in the marketplace for both. If anything, the paid game market is relatively booming right now, thanks to things like Steam and KickStarter. But you aren&rsquo;t contributing anything to the betterment of free-to-play games by knocking them solely based upon price.</p>
