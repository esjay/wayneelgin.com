                    <p>Last year, comedian Louis CK became even more notable than he already was for pioneering an inexpensive, DRM-free release of his annual comedy special for his fans. $5 was a lot less than he could ask, and DRM-free was a lot more than comedy fans would expect. It&rsquo;s no surprise in hindsight that the special sold like fried bananas and made $1m within the year. </p>
<p>Fast forward to now. Today, Louis CK is <a href="http://buy.louisck.net/news/im-going-on-the-road">announcing the start of his new tour</a>. That happens pretty often. But the real news is that it&rsquo;s $45 flat for all tickets (tax is included). Louis has chosen to circumvent Ticketmaster to make the show more affordable for fans and he&rsquo;s built some language into the ticket contract to disallow &ldquo;scalping&rdquo; to keep the tickets at that price. </p>
<p>In his announcement, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that there was not a financial incentive to do this; Louis makes more money from Ticketmaster, even though they charge more, and he&rsquo;s had to invest into the ticketing system (and probably the scalping enforcement, too).</p>
<p>Louis seems practical, but I also think he doesn&rsquo;t care much about capitalism. Scalping in theory never really bothered me. I&rsquo;d always rather pay less for my tickets, but scalpers (in a vacuum) are a reaction to the gap between value and the price of a performance multiplied by scarcity of the item. The only reason scalping seems bad is that there is money on each ticket not being received by the original seller. That sounds a lot like the David Lowery&rsquo;s disdain for Google and other ad purveyors scalping off of the top of file sharing activities.</p>
<p>But scalping enforcement aside, this is such a good disruption of the existing ticket sales effective monopoly that it can&rsquo;t be ignored. I have to think that this would be very close to how the crops of musicians would do business if there were less governmental protections for their songs. Comedy is a very different beast than music: it&rsquo;s longer form, less memorizable, and can get stagnant. Louis is even more unique than the average comedian, because he does a fresh hour of material every year that he works out by doing lots of little shows.</p>
<p>Some musicians do it this way, but the vast majority have done recording first, touring with that set second. David Lowery even <a href="http://thetrichordist.wordpress.com/2012/06/18/letter-to-emily-white-at-npr-all-songs-considered/">mentioned</a> how ridiculous it was that musicians are coming to this point:</p>
<blockquote>The vast majority of artists do not make significant money on the road. Until recently, most touring activity was a money losing operation. The idea was the artists would make up the loss through recorded music sales. This has been reversed by the financial logic of file-sharing and streaming. You now tour to support making albums if you are very, very lucky. Otherwise, you pay for making albums out of your own pocket. Only the very top tier of musicians make ANY money on the road.</blockquote>
<p>This logic wouldn&rsquo;t need to be reversed if it hadn&rsquo;t been implanted by the last 60 years of the recording industry. As David says, all of your album costs have to be covered first from the album sales, and even then you are booking your tour through your record company, who gets a cut after Ticketmaster and the venue get theirs.</p>
<p>One last point: Seth Godin just wrote a short article about the <a href="http://www.thedominoproject.com/2012/06/watching-the-price-of-media-fall.html">price of making media falling</a> that is extremely relevant along these lines. One excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>What happens to the market leaders when there’s no restriction on what gets “on the air” and when the competitors have a cost basis that’s 10% of yours? … That’s not a cost-efficiency. That’s a totally different industry. But the if the viewer/reader doesn’t treat the two products as fundamentally different, if reading or watching one is a replacement for the other, then a crisis is right around the corner.</blockquote>
<p>Bingo. Musicians and comedians of the future won&rsquo;t be fighting piracy, because the pirates aren&rsquo;t customers. They are fighting for attention against the deluge of inexpensive competitors.</p>
