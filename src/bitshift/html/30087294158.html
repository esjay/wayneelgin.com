                                    <h1>Apple Detracts from Gaming's Ecosystem</h1>
                    <p>I know there has been a lot of love for the Apple iOS devices, and there will doubtless continue to be as the next generation of them roll out for this holiday season. But Apple has always been, and appears to continue to be, detrimental to the video gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>The Good Parts of Apple in Gaming</strong></p>
<p>Probably the best contribution Apple has to the modern video gaming world is that it elevated high level devices into the norm. So much so that average consumers are playing games that otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be just because they have an iOS device that is game capable. This timed very nicely with the practical shunning of the PC by major game publishers from about 2004-2009, which in turn resulted in a boom of indie games being welcomed on the PC. Lots of those same indie developers, or on-lookers, saw a redemptive opportunity in the iPhone and subsequently the iPad. And, despite a few barnacles, I think most gamers appreciate the increased respect that video games received from the iPhone effect. </p>
<p>BTW, Countless video game designers credit the Apple IIe as a big early influence into their life designing software and making games. That&rsquo;s awesome, but that&rsquo;s not the Apple that I&rsquo;m talking about today. </p>
<p><strong>The Bad Apple</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asserting that, once a game is introduced to the iOS <a href="http://www.apple.com/game-center/">Game Center</a>, it&rsquo;s locked there and that is bad for a few reasons:</p>
<p>Apple pretty blatantly prefers itself to be the only avenue for iOS apps to make digital dollars. That&rsquo;s completely within their right. But it prevents benevolent companies from extending the utility of the another purchase into the iOS world. For instance, Dynamite Jack developer Galcon <a href="http://indiegames.com/2012/08/galcon_dev_experiments_with_no.html">wanted to make a cross-platform purchase of the game available</a> on both the PC and iOS devices.  To do so, he could only have the initial purchase happen on the iOS App Store in order to reciprocate to the PC. This is only possible because download stores like the Humble Store in this case or Steam in others permit this to happen for free. If everybody walled off their purchases this way, nobody could do cross-platform reciprocation. That sucks. </p>
<p>Because Apple is so prominent, they can get away with doing this and it keeps all the 30% cuts coming in to them. It&rsquo;s a potentially great thing for Apple in two ways; it slows the buildout of a ubiquitous game ownership across all devices and it continues to earn them all of the money.</p>
<p>If Steam began stating that all transactions that reciprocate to other platforms now had to pay Steam its 30%, I suspect game devs would be a bit up in arms about it. But devs that have worked with Apple in the past know that it&rsquo;s just par for the course. </p>
<p><strong>Apple Doesn&rsquo;t Care</strong></p>
<p>We might also see Apple tempted to do the same thing with its Mac App Store. Certainly, that&rsquo;s the temptation Windows developers seem to believe Microsoft is facing.</p>
<p>And the Mac is interesting, because I recall the 2007 Quakecon keynote. In it, John Carmack lamented Apple&rsquo;s on-again-off-again relationship with video games while wishing they would take advantage of the unique position they have and <a href="http://youtu.be/WUoKSEn4Qrc?t=27m25s">optimize gaming performance across their machines</a> since they are the only company to have absolute control over all of their hardware. That&rsquo;s probably never going to happen and it&rsquo;s a shame. But it&rsquo;s really the fool-me-twice side of Apple that saddens me the most. Such as anecdotes of game developers being courted by Apple with promises of a sort of game-focused renaissance only to be let down by the inevitable lack of support.</p>
<p>Apple is good at making its own business decisions, and they are within their right to do that. I also would love to see viable PC gaming alternatives to Windows. But jumping from sort-of-closed Windows frying pan to almost-totally-shut iOS or Mac the fire doesn&rsquo;t need to happen.</p>
