                    <p>Chik-Fil-A is in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/s/Chick-fil-A/posts">spotlight</a> for a moment and most internet people seem to have already made their mind up about what side they are taking forever. But while it&rsquo;s easy to assume that the people who support or reject Dan Cathy&rsquo;s opinions are only making a response based upon that, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to consider a few pieces that make up the internet opinion puzzle.</p>
<p>A large percentage reactions on either side obviously are missing key pieces of the story. Because of that, and likely because of other recent news pieces such as Barack Obama&rsquo;s statements, the imagination will fill in all of the gaps with other stories until your mind has enough of the picture to work from. But for those few who are critically thinking about what was said, the obvious focus is to see what wasn&rsquo;t said. </p>
<p>Among the things <em>not </em>said by Cathy: &ldquo;Chik-Fil-A will not hire homosexuals,&rdquo; &ldquo; Chik-Fil-A will not serve homosexuals,&rdquo; &ldquo; Chik-Fil-A will discriminate against any and all homosexual activity on its premises,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chik-Fil-A believes homosexual individuals are less than human,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chik-Fil-A hates homosexuals,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chik-Fil-A supports the hatred of homosexuals via donations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You probably didn&rsquo;t need me to tell you that. But the mayor of Boston must need to hear that, because he thinks that statements about the religious beliefs of the COO of Chik-Fil-A equates to corporate-wide discrimination against a group of people. Why else would he pledge to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/chick-fil-a-gay_n_1689800.html">ban the company</a> from opening a store in the city?</p>
<p>Much of the controversy started with an EqualityMatters <a href="http://equalitymatters.org/factcheck/201207020001">report</a> on the company, as far as the news goes. It seems they did one <a href="http://equalitymatters.org/factcheck/201111010001">last year</a>, too, that was nearly identical, but nobody remembers that. It&rsquo;s actually fairly difficult to nail down where the &ldquo;hate group&rdquo; remarks came from, but apparently it boils down to the Family Research Council (one of the groups Chik-Fil-A donates to through its WinShape organization) being <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/family-research-council">called a lot of negative-sounding names</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center (which, despite its objective-sounding name, is actually a largely pro-gay-rights law center).</p>
<p>Identifying the source of the &ldquo;hate group&rdquo; label as a group of lawyers with vested interests really changes the nature of the allegations from scientific to a he-said/she-said. The word picture &ldquo;hate group&rdquo; summons is more violent than is actually occurring. </p>
<p>There are some other clarifying points that could be made about more apparent misconceptions, but this isn&rsquo;t Snopes. The only reason I&rsquo;m writing about this topic here is because social currency, even on the internet, has some value, as I&rsquo;ve said before. But, with all of the information available at our fingertips, I think we all assume that we can trust the things we read to be true. I don&rsquo;t even trust that what I wrote above is true, because it only took me 40 minutes to find it. Right now, you just know there are people on your Facebook that are leaping to their own conclusions based upon someone else&rsquo;s conclusions thrice removed from an article. And that article maybe was only slightly better researched than this one, if that (they have deadlines, I don&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>So, the messy side of social currency on the internet is its rapid devaluation at the hands of sloppy follow-up and too many assumptions. But everyone, no matter how uninformed or how disagreeable, gets their vote. For now. They get their +1 or their Like or their one username (or three or ten). And these people are, en masse, pressuring companies, politicians, non-profits, Amazon customers, and musicians to comply with their ill-conceived whims.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s messier still is that the targets of those whims are overwhelmed with that volume of response. They never planned to have such easy feedback come to their attention and when it does (this is the internet we&rsquo;re talking about, so it&rsquo;s often from people they are not serving) it elicits <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChickfilA/posts/10151226208515101">swift responses</a>. Eventually, somebody will rescale the system so it measures up to reality.</p>
<p>Until then, proceed with caution. That 1 star review might just be from someone for whom you have no respect.</p>
