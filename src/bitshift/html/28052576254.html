                                    <h1>Piracy isn't a factor of success</h1>
                    <p>In one week, we can go from talking about mobile game <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/07/25/notch-on-why-minecraft-still-isnt-on-steam/">Dead Trigger&rsquo;s allegedly high piracy rate</a> (and implying that MadFinger Games is not making much money on it, which I somehow doubt) straight over to the PC world: you know, that place where software piracy was born and continues to be nurtured.</p>
<p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="183" data-orig-width="500"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/3e51224d2f9972f9b7c38ab3d0892aad/cef4e2c9ad285803-7e/s540x810/8a755220b77d5cf28345ad3f12a986bd39d3a314.png" data-orig-height="183" data-orig-width="500"/></figure></p>
<p>PC piracy doesn&rsquo;t seem to be declining at all (at least not in absolute terms), despite lots of new legislation across countries designed to discourage it. I don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time on the piracy part again, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that not everybody who uses software looks like you do (and I don&rsquo;t even know what you look like). As I said in the Dead Trigger article, <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_sof_pir_rat-crime-software-piracy-rate">most of the pirating seems correlated</a> to the east European, west Asian, or African  countries. And it shouldn&rsquo;t come as any surprise; bootlegging is something of a national past time there. That might be terrible if this was 18 years ago and your game was only releasing in the retail shops of Armenia, where software piracy is 93%.</p>
<p>But in the actual world, a software developer has a far different reality. The same bridges that make piracy simpler, can also make it far less hassle to just legally acquire software for cheap&hellip; at least for countries who have non-corrupt banking systems (speaking of Armenia, it&rsquo;s at least corrupt enough to have it&rsquo;s own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Armenia">&ldquo;Corruption in Armenia&rdquo; Wikipedia article</a>). My point, which I&rsquo;ve made before, is that pirates will statistically be pirates, for all of the reasons that they are pirates already. It&rsquo;s most likely tied to depravity of man combined with an immediate, connected global economy and nearly perfect anonymity. </p>
<p>Because of that, I don&rsquo;t know how useful it is for companies to track what percentage of their users are pirates (MadFinger decided to <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/Madfinger+news/news.asp?c=43449">drop a number on us</a>, too bad it was a percentage), because the pirate users aren&rsquo;t customers. They&rsquo;re effectively demo players until they enter into your court of legitimate users. The real hurt comes from deciding to tie in the networking components of an in-app purchasing system and possibly centralized servers for gameplay. Just like <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/04/demigod-hit-by-massive-piracy-review-scores-take-beating/">StarDock saw when Demigod was pirated</a> upon release, that soaks up a lot of available resources and degrades the experience for paying customers. That game is made to be a multiplayer, connected game (and is a great game, by the way). Piracy swings the load around pretty heavily and can really hurt the profitability of the publisher if a circumvention isn&rsquo;t applied.</p>
<p>So, with all of that said, it&rsquo;s kind of thrilling to see Stardock enjoying a <a href="http://www.stardock.com/about/newsitem.asp?id=2738">very profitable all-digital release of Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion</a>. Wardell has always been very protective of shelf sales in the past, so his discussion of the digital sales response to the new Sins game is very encouraging.</p>
<p>Likewise, Minecraft got a little attention recently when <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/07/25/notch-on-why-minecraft-still-isnt-on-steam/">PC Gamer inquired</a> why Notch hasn&rsquo;t moved it to Steam since a number of his concerns are no longer Minecraft easily doesn&rsquo;t need Steam to be successful, since PC Gamer speculates it currently makes a million dollars every three days. I don&rsquo;t really think that Minecraft is in a significantly different category of game than Dead Trigger, and it&rsquo;s managing to be profitable without in-app purchasing and never had to worry much about its pirates.</p>
<p>Maybe, in a world where anyone can get any game, they only want to pay for the good ones.</p>
