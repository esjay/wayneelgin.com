                    <p><img alt="Original Source unknown, via http://www.moddb.com/groups/pc-gamers/images/pc-game-collection" height="320" src="http://rookery9.aviary.com.s3.amazonaws.com/14092000/14092394_b696.png" width="569"/></p>
<p>I read Tom Stanley&rsquo;s books and blogs about rich people and how wrong everybody is about them. One finding that should be a book unto itself is that many millionaires have a <a href="http://www.thomasjstanley.com/blog-articles/399/Build_Wealth_to_Control_Your_Own_Destiny.html" target="_blank">&ldquo;go to hell&rdquo; fund</a>. When your job or boss stops being fun or starts being demanding, you have enough money to walk away and take your time finding something better. Everybody wants that.</p>
<p>PC gaming is so cheap, the cost of an Xbox 360 will get you dozens of quality games, between countless pay-what-you-want bundles and regular Steam sales. But what&rsquo;s the long tail effect of so many playthings for so little cash? Lots of people have opinions on this and a surprising number of folks are worried about devaluation of games with lower incentive for high-quality work.</p>
<p>Of course, doing so treats digital distribution like shelf distribution which is an error of enormous magnitude. The cost of sending some bits over the internet is so low that it&rsquo;s effectively zero. The more people you can get playing your game at whatever cost they can afford only cements your brand into their brain-space. And make no mistake, brain-space is the far more limited than shelf-space.</p>
<p>Lots of good games come from independent developers. My friends and I have this conversation weekly for the last 4 years or more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, I really want to get [new game that is coming out].&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it looks cool. But I already have a bunch of games I need to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, me too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The real effect of ridiculously cheap games delivered instantly is that it empowers the gamer with choice. Too much choice, maybe, if such a thing exists. When AAA game publishers want to charge $60 for their latest iteration and won&rsquo;t drop the price for 3 years (*cough* Activision/Blizzard), my growing list of well-made, convention-challenging indie games is my quickly-depreciating &ldquo;go to hell&rdquo; fund. If I really want to get a new game I still can, but I&rsquo;m not trapped to payÂ exorbitantly-colluded prices that consolers dole out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right: I have go-to-hell games.</p>
