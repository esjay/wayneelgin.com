                                    <h1>Steam Me Up</h1>
                    <p><img alt="Some grandpa will see these and be amazed that you can buy ready-to-use steam vapor so cheaply" height="250" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2128714/steam-wallet-cards.png" width="515"/></p>
<p>Steam Wallet cards are finally a physical thing that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/redeemwalletcode">you can buy</a> for your virtual games, and if you ask me it&rsquo;s too long in coming. It pains me to have relatives overspend for games that I don&rsquo;t *need* when I know that, given half of the cost of those same games, I&rsquo;d stretch the value out over time and get many more games.</p>
<p>That GameStop is participating in this first is very telling, because they have their own digital platform (they <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/gamestop-acquires-impulse-spawn-labs-6306673">acquired Impulse</a> from Stardock a while ago). Usually, GameStop is content to pretend that the rest of the gaming industry doesn&rsquo;t exist. So acknowledging Steam and also being willing to skim just a little off the top versus arranging a similar deal for Impulse tells me that GameStop knows Steam is a lot bigger than the rest of the industry thinks it is.</p>
<p>So far, EA&rsquo;s Origin service has garnered bad blood with core PC gamers because of its Steam-blind eye that caused a frustrating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(content_delivery)#Removal_of_Crysis_2_from_Steam_and_Origin_exclusives">lack of games</a> where there should be some. Its recent attempt at good will by <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-05-18-ea-origin-platform-to-host-crowd-funded-game-for-free">waiving digital publishing fees</a> for crowd-funded games seems like too little pandering too late from the publisher that established the much-maligned annual game update model.Â </p>
<p>As a consumer, I tend to want choice more than not-choice. I don&rsquo;t want Origin to die, but I personally hate splitting my library up across many services. If you want to win customers in the digital market, find new ways to add more value instead of creating more scarcity.</p>
