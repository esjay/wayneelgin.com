                                    <h1>Who's Liable for Driverless Car Accidents? The Other Person</h1>
                    <p><a href="http://bgr.com/2013/01/29/google-driverless-car-liability-laws-309926/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheBoyGeniusReport+%28BGR+%7C+Boy+Genius+Report%29">Boy Genius Report discussed one of the hurdles of driverless car adoption</a> for lawmakers is in predetermining the liability of a driverless vehicle in an accident. Certainly, much of this will fall upon a case-by-case basis, anyway. However, given the nature of how the driverless cars are being constructed, their appeal is in how much they are taking control out of the hands of the driver. This would allow other entertainment or productivity to be pursued as the car is fulfilling its transportation request and would most likely alleviate the reason for many accidents: rushed maneuvers.</p>
<p>But, as the laws are currently constructed in many states, the autonomous vehicles must remain &ldquo;driven&rdquo; by a human remaining ready at the wheel. As long as that&rsquo;s a requirement, there will always be a question as to the nature of the accident. It seems a given to me that any autonomous system with such critical importance would have a black-box type of system where every decision of the vehicle is logged, including when a human manually intervened. And as soon as a human intervenes, the court will have to treat the car as all cars have been treated: a tool of its user.</p>
<p>When a car malfunctions without any intervention or when it is operating properly but with perhaps wrong information (e.g., the signage is blocked or the dividing lines of lanes are erased), what happens? I suggest first, that we consider a simplified look at the stakeholders of a given vehicle interaction:</p>
<p>The autonomous car&rsquo;s would-be driver, who has sacrificed their driving choice for the sake of a slower drive and ideally increased average safety</p>
<p>The autonomous car&rsquo;s insurance provider, who prefers safer customers in general</p>
<p>The autonomous car manufacturer, who desires a sterling reputation and customer good will</p>
<p>The autonomous car&rsquo;s passengers, who desire safety from the vehicle</p>
<p>The other vehicles&rsquo; drivers and passengers, who expect safety from other vehicles sharing the road</p>
<p>Imagine you are an insurance provider and a prospective customer comes to you for a quote. He or she just purchased an autonomous car. For the moment, let&rsquo;s assume that an insurance industry representative group has rigorously tested and validated the absolute increased safety of these vehicles versus human driven cars and especially noticed a large safety bump in the area the driver will spend most of their time (almost certainly, the testing will happen). You, as the insurance provider, have a huge incentive to attract these safer customers into your business. Because the less you end up paying on claims, the more profit you stand to make from premiums as a percentage. So, you will, wisely choose to underwrite the risk of the autonomous car.</p>
