                                    <h1>Valve's Desire to Remove Steam's Greatest Limitation (which is Valve, BTW)</h1>
                    <p>Valve&rsquo;s Gabe Newell was discussing the future of gaming, as he is wont to do, and made some statements that might seem jarring to&ndash; well, anybody at EA, for sure. But the gist is that <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/01/gabe-newell-on-removing-valve-from-steam/">nobody really wants Valve to curate the Steam catalog</a>. They want what they want to be available and that the market would make sure to get their stuff from whomever is willing to give them that.</p>
