                                    <h1>Was Dead Trigger's Piracy Planned All Along?</h1>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s always interesting, to me, how differently developers can respond to piracy. MadFinger is choosing to make its Dead Trigger game free based upon allegedly &ldquo;unbelievably high&rdquo; and &ldquo;giant&rdquo; piracy. As Android Central points out, however, those aren&rsquo;t quantifiable measures. Thus, some hyperbolic headline straight from the school of &ldquo;things you don&rsquo;t need to prove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not questioning whether or not it&rsquo;s happening, but I do believe it&rsquo;s prudent to question the response of changing the price from $0.99 to free. Just some light research into this developer&rsquo;s recent decisions regarding the app reveals that Dead Trigger wasn&rsquo;t a thing that mattered statistically prior to Google I/O 2012. See this chart from <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/?q=shadowgun,+dead+trigger,+dead+trigger+apk&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=mtd&amp;sort=0">Google Trends</a>:</p>

<p>You may or may not recall that Dead Trigger was one of the demo apps showing off the hardware power of Google&rsquo;s new tablet. At that point (June 27th, or the first red bump up in the chart), the game was not yet released. It wasn&rsquo;t until July 2nd when it was released on the Play store (the day before the first orange bump in the chart, which correlated to interest in the APK). If you look at both the red and orange  lines, they are both trending downward following their release date spike. That seems to make sense to me. Especially if it&rsquo;s as meh as Shadowgun was (I have yet to play Dead Trigger). Measuring piracy is tricky, so it&rsquo;d be nice just to see which internal metrics MadFinger was using determine the &ldquo;unbelievably high&rdquo; rate. Even DRM companies get these measures wrong. And the target audience following the game&rsquo;s release (the game was shown to millions of Android devs, a decent sized portion of which were physically in attendance at I/O and walked away with multiple devices) may cloud the issue significantly more than Shadowgun&rsquo;s release.</p>
<p>The other thing that jumps out at me is the list of regions that popped up below the trend lines.</p>
<p><figure data-orig-height="280" data-orig-width="285"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/93389c750f028498d3955a8faa98deee/f936c3713dbff9b3-55/s540x810/6248f2d68429eeb62e2002bba99ef6d4c8ea5634.png" data-orig-height="280" data-orig-width="285"/></figure> </p>
<p>While this list is sorted by Shadowgun, it&rsquo;s the long red Russian line that represents Dead Trigger search volume for the last 30 days. Here&rsquo;s the same list but sorted by the Dead Trigger search:</p>
<p><figure data-orig-height="300" data-orig-width="279"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/172a0ac020d4aef68528eba7a503b935/f936c3713dbff9b3-e9/s540x810/e4449414f8e70df00554e8a064cab7d09cecf965.png" data-orig-height="300" data-orig-width="279"/></figure></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not a huge surprise that the most interest comes from MadFinger&rsquo;s own Czech Republic and similar Eastern European countries. Many of these countries are statistically correlated to the <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_sof_pir_rat-crime-software-piracy-rate">highest rates of software piracy</a>, in general. Whether or not we understand the reasons behind why someone is searching for a given Android app, we don&rsquo;t have to blame Android if the country&rsquo;s citizenry is hostile towards intellectual property anyway (Fun fact, the US is the last on that list at 20%, so consider that when writing your anti-piracy articles).</p>
<p>Because this is an easy press story, most of the stories I&rsquo;m reading are just accepting the claims made by MadFinger. Phil at Android Central is the first I saw to question the claim, albeit indirectly. I was inspired to write this post after seeing this snippet from MadFinger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyway - DEAD TRIGGER is not FREEMIUM, it always was and still remains FREE-TO-PLAY, that means, all players are able to play it without IAP!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect there is probably some weak English at play that clouds this quite a bit. However, &ldquo;it always was and still remains free-to-play&rdquo; hints to me that there was at least some form of plan from the beginning to have this game be free. I speculate that it&rsquo;s reasonable to see the game plan went like this:</p>
<ol><li>Develop Dead Trigger app with F2P engine complete with requisite in-app purchasing</li>
<li>Show off at Google I/O</li>
<li>Set price of app low enough to be palatable for users who find in-app purchases tempting (and capitalize on the hype from Google I/O)</li>
<li>Release app</li>
<li>Profit</li>
<li>Set price to free after initial hype dies down to further open the in-app purchases market</li>
<li>Profit some more</li>
</ol><p>If you read the angry app reviews, it&rsquo;s quickly apparent that a lot of miffed users feel this was the plan all along. Android pirates would be a great scapegoat and if you don&rsquo;t have to show your evidence, all the better.</p>
