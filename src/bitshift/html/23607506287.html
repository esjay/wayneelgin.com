                                    <h1>Steam Sales and Indie Bundles Prevent More Piracy than DRM Ever Has</h1>

<p>I have a bone to pick with pay-what-you-want bundles. Like a lot of PC gamers 3 years ago, I loved the prospect of snagging undiscovered games for whatever amount I selected.</p>
<p>Want all of Introversions titles for 50 cents? Done. </p>
<p>Want Frozen Synapse for $20? Likewise.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, this good idea spawned a thousand other good ideas from our indie-bundling benefactors. You can&rsquo;t walk through a gaming blog without tripping over 3 copies of Machinarium and World of Goo for every conceivable platform.</p>
<p>Is this a problem?</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;problem.&rdquo; We like choices and pay-what-you-want gives us more of them. Why then are so many in the gaming community disgruntled by naming a price? I suspect it&rsquo;s the consistent, visible devaluing of the thing we paid money for not that long ago.</p>
<p>But, besides the customer winning, there are some more industry-wide positives to this. Namely, reducing the <em>reasons</em> for customers to pirate games. Steam et. al. help to reduce piracy by giving us a never-ending supply of games to play for relatively cheap. Why am I going to pirate a game that is new and costs $60 when I don&rsquo;t even have time to play the hundreds of other games I already own?</p>
<p>Low pricing doesn&rsquo;t solve all piracy (nothing will), but it has done far more to prevent the impetus for pirating a game than restrictive DRM ever has.</p>
