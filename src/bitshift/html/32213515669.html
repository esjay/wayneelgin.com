                                    <h1>Tapping the Back Catalog</h1>
                    <p>If EA and Ubisoft really want to be a competitor with Steam, they should at minimum do what Steam did for Valve games.</p>
<p>Pretty much since the Steam client was released in 2003, Valve allowed you to tie your previously bought (physical disc-based, mind you) PC game keys to it.</p>
<p>As Origin and Ubisoft stand, unless I&rsquo;ve bought some of their games very recently, I&rsquo;m a brand new customer. I don&rsquo;t have any history with either their published or house-developed games. </p>
<p>While a platform may not be able to control what third-party publishers choose to do with their back catalogs, if a game exists on the publisher&rsquo;s own platform and there is a list of legal CD keys in some database, it stands to reason that there&rsquo;s an immediate gift of customer buy-in that you can give your marketing department. </p>
<p>Much like format shifting in the movie industry, making the leap to your new platform requires a significant amount of faith that you will do what you say you&rsquo;re going to do for me. Not just now, but 3, 5, and 8 years from now. Both EA and Ubisoft have exponentially more game years in their catalog than Valve does. It&rsquo;s a real shame to presume that their customers don&rsquo;t value that.</p>
<p>Whatever it costs to make it so that my original Sims CD registers on your platform will be worth it, because it may convince me that I&rsquo;m not being sold on a new platform at all: I&rsquo;ve been on it the whole time and just unlocked new value.</p>
