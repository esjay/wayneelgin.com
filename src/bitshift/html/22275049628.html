                    <p>It&rsquo;s easy to start something, but it&rsquo;s hard to persist. Blogs are the worst.</p>
<p>In the spirit of all first blog posts, I&rsquo;m going to be unrealistically optimistic and fail to meet my own expectations. The difference, I keep telling myself, is that I&rsquo;m not going to stop once I fall short.</p>
<p>Something about streaming media here&hellip; in this space&hellip; every MWF.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unrealistic. And it will certainly be wrong a lot. But it will not be wrong sometimes and that will be better than nothing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only doing this because I have a lot of opinions about digital content (video games on Steam, books on Kindle, movies on Netflix, apps on everything) and I think about it almost daily. I might as well start writing about it, I think?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really cliche to say the future is now, because you knew that we&rsquo;d be buying ones and zeroes 15 years ago. But, what happens after the now-future-from-yesterday? I don&rsquo;t know. So, let&rsquo;s start shifting some bits around.</p>
<p>Oh, and first!</p>
