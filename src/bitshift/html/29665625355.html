                                    <h1>Is GameStop OnLive's Unknown Buyer? Update: Nope</h1>
                    <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> After this article was written, the buyer was <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/08/20/onlives-mysterious-benefactor-revealed-almost-half-of-origin/">revealed to be Lauder Partners</a>.</p>
<p>The big news today for digital distribution is the gigantic question mark hovering over <a href="http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/8/17/3250066/onlive-cloud-gaming-service-closing-staff-laid-off">whatever is going on at OnLive headquarters</a>. If the company really is declining, it would seem odd given all the investments they&rsquo;ve been making in third-party hardware positions (such as the <a href="http://www.vizio.com/costar/overview">Vizio Co-Star</a> and the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console">OUYA Android console</a>). As well as the indie game giveaways recently. Lots of the articles are talking about an unknown buyer being the cause of the layoffs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not seeing anybody mention that <a href="http://androidcommunity.com/gamestops-game-streaming-service-arrives-in-2013-20120817/">Gamestop also announced a renewed push towards streaming gaming with it&rsquo;s already-announced Spawn service</a>Â today. GameStop bought Kongregate and Impulse recently, and announced their intention to start carrying tablets. And many of us remember the backlash following when Gamestop decided to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/report-gamestop-opening-deus-ex-copies-removing-free-game-code/">remove OnLive vouchers</a> from Deus Ex: Human Revolution boxes last year. It seems pretty clear that community goodwill is not something GameStop stumbles across unless it buys up an existing community.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m no stock analyst, but when OnLive has an unknown buyer and GameStop has a renewed interest in streaming on the same day&hellip;</p>
