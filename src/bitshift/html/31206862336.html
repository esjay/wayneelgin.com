<p>Greenlight&rsquo;s asking for money&hellip; then giving it to a charity. </p>
<p>Indie game developers are balking at the audacity of Steam asking for money for putting up a project submission&hellip; so that the developers can ask for money from the customers.</p>
<p>If the money Steam is charging isn&rsquo;t a profit, what is it? It&rsquo;s for the permission to grasp a hold of an audience. A discerning, money-waving audience with limited time to pore over 500 Half Life 3 joke game submissions or 1,000 ideas without enough promise to convince the author to develop it.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s define what we mean by art. Nobody is stopping you from making your video game as art project for free on a barebone computer. But you still need to earn the right to get it in front of an audience. Video games are to traditional arts like painting and singing as water polo or the biathalon is to traditional sports like running. You don&rsquo;t exactly stumble into it.</p>
<p>Honestly, if the $100 is making or breaking you as a developer, I don&rsquo;t want you hanging your life upon whether or not it gets accepted into Steam. I want you to succeed, but please go deliver pizza for a couple of months to build up a reserve. </p>
<p>Remember, the average small business is started with $5,000 in capital. Consider that, if you got this far on less than $100 invested, you are way below the average. So, take a moment, gratefully reflect on how blessed you were to develop a prototype game for less than a Benjamin, and fork over the submission fee. Oh, and then work tirelessly promoting your thing every waking moment.</p>
