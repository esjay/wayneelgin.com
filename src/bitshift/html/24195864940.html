                                    <h1>What is Netflix Scarce of?</h1>
                    <p>Disney is a big fan of its own infamous &ldquo;Vault,&rdquo; where it puts a given movie on ice until it rereleases it. And it seems to be a successful ploy for monetizing the same old content decade after decade. But, will it always be?</p>
<p>The average Disney consumer is probably at a different stage of life by the time one version of the movie is brought back out to retail shelves. Someone who was watching the movies at age 13 might be considering having their own children at age 23, and may be very likely to buy for their children by age 33.  This naturally works out very well for the folks with the Vault combination, but what of the vast drift between those expanses?</p>

<p>If the above Google Trends chart is any indicator, interest in Beauty and the Beast has stayed right around the 1 line for most of the last decade, with spikes of doubling interest around the rerelease of it on video. If we assume that this correlates to sales, Disney&rsquo;s scarcity plan is probably working. </p>
<p>My only criticism about creating artificial scarcity is that it&rsquo;s getting very easy to ignore scarcity for these types of works. Even before downloading a movie was one click away, there was Betamax and VHS, which is how many people watched movies 20 years ago. And used sales are no longer a black art, but is now a viable way to build a video collection. Artificial scarcity still works, but I think it works differently.</p>
<p>Netflix, on the other hand, inadvertently (and I would suppose undesirably for them) creates scarcity by negotiating and renegotiating studio contracts by working around exclusivity agreements that are holdovers from the era of broadcast television. It used to be a source of frustration that your favorite movies would disappear off of the service, but it&rsquo;s becoming a more important way to decide what you want to watch right now. InstantWatcher.com has long had an <a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles/expiring?view=box_art&amp;popups=1&amp;infinite=1">Expiring Soon</a> filter and there was even a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/queuenoodle">Twitter bot account</a> dedicated to finding the best movies about to leave Netflix (for some undetermined amount of time).</p>
<p>Maybe some smart movie studio will increase their bid for contract renewal and start preemptively advertising their soon-to-expire movies as &ldquo;going into the Netflix vault.&rdquo;</p>
