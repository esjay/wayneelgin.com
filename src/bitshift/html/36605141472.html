                    <p>It&rsquo;s interesting that <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/11/26/steam-guard-soon-to-be-required-for-all-steam-trading/">Steam Guard is being made a requirement</a> for all trades made using the Steam platform. Not because Steam Guard is any kind of scheme, but because the long-term viability of a Steam-based trading system was derision-worthy a few years ago. It&rsquo;s now hitting the point where Russian money launderers have found TF2 to be a trading system that works for them.Â </p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t really prove anything over such a short time span. But if you believe that crime follows the paths of least resistance, the virtual economy in the form of TF2 has been somewhat more lucrative than some of my too-big-to-fail investments in the real world.</p>
