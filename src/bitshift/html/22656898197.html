                    <p>Today, NewTeeVee <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2012/05/07/dishs-ergen-streaming-on-netflix-devalues-mad-men/">discusses</a> the contract renewal negotiations between Dish Network and AMC that are coming to a head over the devaluing of shows that are available for streaming on other services. As we said <a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/22589424377/your-greatest-competitor">before</a>, there is probably some devaluation going on in the minds of consumers thanks to ubiquitous streaming content.</p>
<p>But Dish is arguing it&rsquo;s only the content that is being devalued to give them the high ground. What they mean is that the Dish service is being devalued by lack of exclusives. A spinster might say Dish is being &ldquo;right-valued,&rdquo; &ldquo;de-bubbled&rdquo; or similar.</p>
<p>In Dish&rsquo;s utopia, customers pay Dish and Netflix for the same content (well, or Netflix goes away entirely). Both Netflix and Dish are middlemen here. But Netflix is strategizing to give customers the ubiquity they want and Dish is probably hoping to get enough exclusives that customers will ignore the ubiquity of other sources.</p>
<p>Ratings and per-customer revenue are thrown out, but the interesting story here is how content can live and thrive outside of the single delivery-mechanism exclusive. The actual numbers are secretive, but I imagine a number of people follow our story. We discovered Mad Men via word of mouth, just like Dexter and consumed it via Netflix. But these are old episodes and if you want current seasons you either have to wait or pay. How much longer until the good content doesn&rsquo;t originate on the traditional media, but begin online in some way.</p>
<p>This is already happening, if you include YouTube with its ilk or Netflix and Amazon&rsquo;s forays into original programming. I&rsquo;m often discovering more content through my online sources and friend shares than I am via television. And if someone wakes up one day and discovers they don&rsquo;t need their cable or satellite to be entertained or informed, then&hellip;</p>
