                                    <h1>Does Mainstream Even Exist Anymore?</h1>
                    <p>One of the conversations I keep having is how differently we already consume content than we did even 5 years ago. I don&rsquo;t even believe that there is a mainstream anymore. Some people I&rsquo;ve proposed this to are skeptical that this is happening, but readily admit how much content they receive from niche sources such as specific viral YouTube videos that were made famous by Reddit or 4chan. And that&rsquo;s been happening for at least 5 years now. I feel dumb for even explaining it. But the Olympics kind of crystalized things for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably not the only one who notices apparently huge disconnects between what content I follow and what those in my Facebook feed follow. I&rsquo;d been chalking this up to my own disinterest in most of the standard TV fare, but it&rsquo;s gone beyond that in the last couple of years. Some circles are following a certain college team&rsquo;s games and connecting about it, others have no clue about that but are discussing whatever is happening on American Idol. While I didn&rsquo;t watch the Olympics, it seemed to have captured what is now a glaringly large proportion of my social network&rsquo;s attention. The reason the Olympics stood out to me was how out of the flow it was compared to the normal discussions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when &ldquo;the niche&rdquo; segment really tipped past the critical point for me. Mainstream and niche interests are both two sides of the same coin. And economically, that means that cutting the cord is more viable than ever.</p>
<p>The only difference between someone who can drop their cable or even terrestrial antenna is currently their psychological ability to ignore their sense of loss. You may lose access to certain Ohio State games or you may not be able to see the realtime airing of Dancing with the Stars. But, if you can overcome your sense of loss, you will likely find equivalent or even superior content to replace it and at a huge cost savings.</p>
<p>And once the rest of your networks are off discussing their niche content, you may not even find any American Idol fans left to complain to.</p>
