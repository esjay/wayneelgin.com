                                    <h1>Poking the Envelope: How Seth Godin is changing publishing</h1>
                    <p>From &ldquo;dead&rsquo; video game genres to niche board games, there&rsquo;s no shortage of interesting examples of ways that Kickstarter is transforming the landscape of how output is funded. Seth Godin has been one of the biggest encouragers of moving the marketplace forward to catch up with the different ways that we all want to support our favorite authors. As of this morning, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/06/this-might-work-my-new-book.html">Seth had a book project</a> he was trying to fund. Naturally, as all of these Kickstarters have seemed to go recently, the support of his own community has put their money behind him and he surpassed his relatively low funding goal (considering his audience) of $40,000 within hours of the announcement.</p>
<p>My approach to digital sales is very pragmatic, but one thing that many of the overlooked purveyors are doing wrong is that they are not offering new value or experimenting in controlled ways that transform they way they add value in the future. Seth seems to be looking at this project as a way to send a message to his publisher that the book buying public is shifting around their system, which is enough by itself. Added short term value, however, are the neat inclusions of the higher backers&rsquo; stories into the book, itself. Maybe it&rsquo;s not completely original, but think about that from a traditional publisher&rsquo;s mind. A first edition with reader involvement seems very improbable.Â </p>
<p>Also interesting is his forced scarcity of the KickStarter rewards (usually there&rsquo;s at least one unlimited tier, but all of his has a limit, even digital rewards), which practically means that he already knows the maximum probable revenue which he will receive when the whole of it is sold out ($409,890 based upon the suggested pledge amounts). Speaking of scarcity there is no permanent digital edition on offer (we can assume there will be one sold after it&rsquo;s published, but he likes to keep you guessing).</p>
