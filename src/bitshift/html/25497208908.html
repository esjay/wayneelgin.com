                                    <h1>Surface Resurfaces as Non-Surface surface</h1>
                    <p>When Microsoft first announced the Surface back in 2007, I said <a href="http://seinjunkie.livejournal.com/22361.html">it wouldn&rsquo;t happen</a>. I said it in a qualified way and so far, I&rsquo;m still right. But it&rsquo;s easy to disclaim high concept pieces as vaporware.</p>
<p>I said Surface would not work the way that Microsoft was pitching it. And 5 years later, I doubt even Microsoft is surprised to find that it wasn&rsquo;t swept up by every hotel or pub venue out there. The recession didn&rsquo;t help. I hoped I was wrong when I saw the slimmed-down version of Surface that we saw a little while ago. Maybe the approach was getting more realistic. </p>
<p>However, retasking the Surface name (which is great) as a tablet catch-all isn&rsquo;t something that really captures the original vision very well. What&rsquo;s more disappointing, this already feels like an also-will-have-run slate without the ecosystem or inspired developer interest to keep Microsoft&rsquo;s attention for more than 3 months.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the recent &ldquo;meh&rdquo; moments in Microsoft&rsquo;s post-Vista history are easily Microsoft&rsquo;s fault. I guess we can dismiss the Zune and Vista pretty much out of hand. Kin is almost too easy, but I think WinMo 7, or whatever, is just as disappointing. Maybe more niche, but a great example of persistence misdirected, is Games for Windows Live. Xbox is probably their bread and butter and Kinect seemed inspired but poorly unified. They&rsquo;ve done merely okay at tending their own Office and Windows gardens, but mostly have kept up some walls that seemed important to them and let the customers direct the product lines. I guess anything that starts to smell bad terrifies Mr. Ballmer that it reflects upon his supposedly pristine heritage and he runs the other way. Where&rsquo;s the sticktuitiveness? </p>
<p>So does Microsoft even have the attention available to maintain through the impending dip? I am guessing not.</p>
<p>Lots of others have mentioned price as being a big deal, and it is. It&rsquo;s not that this tablet cannot be worth whatever price we are imagining in absolute terms (and I think we&rsquo;re all imagining a price &gt;$500), but in relative terms it&rsquo;s a terrible bet. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bad bet&hellip;</p>
<ul><li>&hellip; that Microsoft will continue investing in this device line for more than 6 months.</li>
<li>&hellip; that the utility of the software will surpass (likely) cheaper devices from Apple and Android-OEMs.</li>
<li>&hellip; that the developers will be nurtured by the WinMo ecosystem (yeah, I&rsquo;m calling it WinMo, again).</li>
<li>&hellip; that there is room in the popular tablet economy for a 3rd/4th player depending upon how you count.</li>
<li>&hellip; that the price will be mind-blowingly cheap before the platform dies.</li>
<li>&hellip; that the market that matters will give Microsoft permission to birth and abort yet another promise within mere weeks.</li>
</ul><p>This initiative could end up surpassing any or all of those things. But I just don&rsquo;t see the fight in Microsoft to keep up with whatever else is going on in the world they&rsquo;ve grown into. </p>
<p>The biggest advantage (this version of) Surface has will be Windows compatibility, but with the disallowance of browsers, it makes me wonder if whatever ends up being the new Microsoft can ever be friends with it&rsquo;s old, legacy-lovin&rsquo; self.</p>
