                                    <h1>GOG.com Admits People Just Like Hoarding Games</h1>
                    <p>A few days ago, <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/10/24/gogs-two-cents-on-retro-mania-drms-demise/">RPS published some excerpts</a> from their interview with Trevor Longino of Good Old Games (GOG.com).  One of the parts that stood out to me most was this:</p>
<p>[A steep game discount is] not good for the industry. But users want the option because they never would’ve bought it otherwise. So our stance was, ‘If you’re buying a game you wouldn’t have bought otherwise unless it was 80 percent off, what are the odds you’re going to play it?’ And our users said, ‘We don’t care. Sometimes we like to collect games, or maybe we’ll play them later. That’s not your concern. Just let us buy the games we want.’</p>
<p>This is an apparent flip flop, after GOG had made some disparaging remarks about discounts in the recent past. EA&rsquo;s Origin spokespeople had echoed similar sentiments, but it was more understandable because 1) They are EA and 2) EA is a game publisher who values its intellectual property more highly than its customers do. But it made sense from GOG&rsquo;s perspective, because the entire premise of the site revolves around cherishing good games, not stacking them up as if all games are just another number.</p>
<p>But, I&rsquo;m somewhat forced to point back to my previous article &ldquo;<a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/22712088021/hoardings-rightful-place-is-in-the-cloud">Hoarding&rsquo;s Rightful Place is in the Cloud</a>,&rdquo; wherein I totally called all this. At least to an extent I did. In a vacuum, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with trying to make digital games scarce. However, since marginal cost is zero, there&rsquo;s also nothing really wrong with introducing steep sales often. Once you make your costs of development or deployment back, everything else is gravy.</p>
<p>This is why &ldquo;<a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/23607506287/steam-sales-and-indie-bundles-prevent-more-piracy-than">Steam Sales and Indie Bundles Prevent More Piracy than DRM</a> (or artificial scarcity for that matter) <a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/23607506287/steam-sales-and-indie-bundles-prevent-more-piracy-than">Ever Has</a> (or will).&rdquo; Because this is not a battle for a larger slice of the pie, but it&rsquo;s more about growing the pie of both money spent on games overall and of types of stuff consumed. This is something that Steam fundamentally understands better than anyone else, because they are watching the pricing experiments and keep having the sales anyway. In fact, Valve discounts its own games far lower than you would expect a pseudo-monopoly to attempt.</p>
<p>Contrast the Steam and Valve model against Apple&rsquo;s own App Store or EA&rsquo;s Origin or Microsoft&rsquo;s XBLA. The difference is striking. Valve seems to be very happily doing what most outsiders believe would be cannibalizing itself over and over again. And is snowballing into a very profitable behemoth. And, while we&rsquo;re comparing Orange (Boxes) to Apples, EA&rsquo;s complaint about <a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/29337784512/which-steam-license-restriction-keeps-ea-games-away">Steam&rsquo;s one camel-back-breaking rule</a> is incredibly superfluous compared to the restrictions that Apple requires of its App Store participants. And yet, EA happily takes part in that money grab.</p>
<p>The long term reciprocation of this on game licenses might seem sketchy to the developers, but to gamers this is just one way to get their attention. You could always make a really great game and keep the price high and see how it goes. :)</p>
