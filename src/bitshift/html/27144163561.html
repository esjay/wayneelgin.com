                                    <h1>Will Steam Greenlight change gaming for good?</h1>
                    <p>Valve just announced its promising <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight">Steam Greenlight program</a>, which turns the Steam platform into less of an old-world physical publishing model and more into a genuine digital experience.</p>
<p>If you read me often, you know I think this is going to be a great step in the right direction. Primarily, this resolves the past debates about good games versus good game developers and what merits the exposure that the Steam platform brings. Given the diversity that inhabits Steam, you might ask, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have known about independent games if it weren&rsquo;t for Steam; is it possible for games to exist outside of it?&rdquo; Well, frankly, yes.</p>
<p>One such past incident happened when noted and opinionated independent developer cliffski attempted to <a href="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2011/02/12/democracy-and-steam/">sell his game &ldquo;Democracy 2&rdquo;</a> on Steam and was rejected because it wouldn&rsquo;t be a good fit. This was after his success with Gratuitous Space Battles, yet before Gratuitous Tank Battles. </p>
<p>Not being a good fit is understandable, given Steam&rsquo;s slick-feeling interface and high-quality game selection. I think, outside of classics, Steam would not want to be another Wild Tangent to the unwary consumer. So, with Steam Greenlight, Valve is intentionally saying that it probably doesn&rsquo;t know much better what the audience wants than the audience does. That&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>But, will the new system hold up past the efforts of unscrupulous game makers to unscrupulously make a game out of gaming Steam? Since Farmville is something everyone knows, I&rsquo;ll use that. When Farmville offers to give its players 2 sheep in exchange for thumbing up its Greenlight page and it rockets to the top of the list, what does that do to the value of the Greenlight system overall? The only prevention against unwanted games are for users to report &ldquo;fake/fraudulent/malicious games.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think social games qualify as any of those, so will they stay?</p>
<p>In the long term, it may not matter, as long as Steam improves its filtering to only show games that you care about. There may be plenty of room for those on Steam. But part of me wishes that some tribute of money could be used for votes, similar to KickStarter. That at least validates that you want the game enough to pay for it and might keep the more, shall I say, undesirable games from view.</p>
