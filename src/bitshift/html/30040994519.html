                                    <h1>Google ChromeOS devices can now play Google Play Videos</h1>
                    <p>As confusing as it was, someone who owned a Google Chromebook could never have played their Google Play videos for the last year and a half, but Netflix and Hulu worked just fine (that speaks to just how ubiquitous Netflix strives to be). So, it&rsquo;s good to hear that <a href="http://gigaom.com/mobile/google-play-video-now-works-on-chromebooks-chromeboxes/">Google is making strides in supporting their own platform with their latest ChromeOS update</a>.</p>
<p>Now, if only Google can find a way to support their own Google TV platform with Google Play videos, I think that would just about cover everything.</p>
