                                    <h1>How Nintendo's trepidation signals real digital market shift</h1>
                    <p>Nintendo, as a company, doesn&rsquo;t embrace the shifting tides nearly as quickly as other players. For instance, they <a href="http://tamspalm.tamoggemon.com/2006/06/03/a-theory-of-fun-and-graphics-quality/">shunned better graphical hardware</a> on the Wii to make room for the Wii remote gameplay, which turned out fantastically for them. They also <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/11/03/03/nintendos.iwata.says.iphone.android.hurt.games/">ignored the swell</a> of free-to-play gaming and continued to push their own kid-friendly games on their 3DS systems. You could make a convincing argument that they&rsquo;re the slowest to adopt the ideas of others, but much more willing to push their own original envelopes, such as risky, unique gameplay mechanisms. </p>
<p>So, when Nintendo <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5915880/nintendos-wii-u-will-have-netflix-hulu-amazon-and-youtube">announces</a> that it will be making more streaming content available on the Wii U, it&rsquo;s a big deal. However dubious the success of their forthcoming console might be, there will be enough Wii U purchasers to raise all of the entertainment center boats with the new living room tide. Nevermind that Netflix on the Wii is old news, this is bringing an official YouTube and Amazon video experience to grandmas and little kids the world over.</p>
<p>If there were any streaming living room holdouts remaining to be converted (especially after Apple does their anticipated thing), Nintendo might be changing their expectations by this time next year.</p>
