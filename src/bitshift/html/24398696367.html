                    <p>The natural enemy of digital goods is digital rights management (DRM). One of the most hated forms of DRM among PC gamers is mandatory constant internet connectivity. Even if you the gamer are online all of the time (&ldquo;all&rdquo; versus &ldquo;most,&rdquo; btw), what happens when the production company decides it&rsquo;s no longer worth it to maintain the authentication server and shut it down? It&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Or, what happens when the launch week is far more popular than tested for, and effectively does the same? It <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/06/01/blizzard-offices-raided-over-diablo-3-refund-policy-after-error-37-strikes-korean-gamers/">happened with Diablo 3</a>, and somewhat still is. So much so, that South Korean gamers are demanding refunds and are being refused by Blizzard&rsquo;s strict policy. Now the FTC is involved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before that <a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/23607506287/steam-sales-and-indie-bundles-prevent-more-piracy-than">DRM isn&rsquo;t stopping much real piracy</a>. The interesting thing about Activision/Blizzard is that they have such draconian ways of policing their game access, and yet the launch price of their games have never dropped to match. I&rsquo;m glad when PC game makers can get more money for making a game, but it&rsquo;s sad that the highest priced games also come with some of the biggest disappointments in their value and service to the customer.</p>
