                                    <h1>Maybe Amazon vs. sales tax won't be terrible</h1>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/small_business/2012/07/amazon_same_day_delivery_how_the_e_commerce_giant_will_destroy_local_retail_.html">the speculation</a> that Amazon is setting itself up to become a local purveyor of its goods. It&rsquo;s all based upon Amazon&rsquo;s sudden willingness to pay state taxes (that it doesn&rsquo;t owe) after fighting for years. Well, no sales tax is one huge reason people buy from the site, and Amazon knows that if its customers are going to see sales tax then they better be getting exponentially higher value from Amazon than from its local stores. So I think the speculation is fairly sound.</p>
<p>I think saying that Amazon will &ldquo;destroy&rdquo; local retail is hyperbole at its best, for now. But I think the interesting aspect is how the bottom line still has plenty of room to shrink via robotic inventory picking in a massive warehouse. Most people were excited to see Amazon acquire Kiva, but I hope Amazon still will license its technology out to other warehousers. Companies like NewEgg could make their (already <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/print/1945">ridiculously</a> <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/2531">efficient</a> warehouse process even more money printing).</p>
<p>The top line opens up a lot more with an approach where customer joy is almost limitless. From desktop to doorstep within hours is going to really up the impulse of low-priced online goods over the few years following its introduction. And at some point, Amazon Prime has to go up. It&rsquo;s beyond the point where $80 is more than the value, I think. So, in total, the total transaction quantity increases and annual membership fee hits maybe $99 to match Costco&rsquo;s Executive program.</p>
<p>Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget, Amazon just officially released its Amazon Local program for deals. It&rsquo;d be a shame to destroy that so quickly.</p>
<p>Actually, instead of destroying local merchants, how about this: Amazon&rsquo;s local positioning enables them to boost local merchants&rsquo; sales by giving them an option for a flexible inventory system and online storefront with same day delivery. That could work just like the Amazon Merchants and Marketplace online system today. The advantage is that local merchants would be the face of interaction and trying the products (especially clothing) while Amazon remains the online front-end, as well as the back-end and logistical shipment pieces of it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of smarter people than me looking at that, no doubt, but Amazon is really great at scaling (see their E3 service). I think Bezos will find an angle that makes sales tax profitable for them and run.</p>
