                                    <h1>When does it make sense to republish a song?</h1>
                    <p>Apparently, over the weekend, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes split up. I don&rsquo;t care about that, but Jonathan Coulton <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathancoulton/statuses/218767414861635584">tweeted</a> to let everyone know he won&rsquo;t be rewriting Tom Cruise Crazy to accommodate their status. &ldquo;Songs are not Wikipedia articles! (yet)&rdquo; He also has not changed &ldquo;Mandelbrot Set&rdquo; to accommodate Benoit Mandelbrot&rsquo;s recent passing, nor has he addressed his own inaccuracy in the song, as he actually is citing the Julia Set.</p>
<p>Nobody expects songs to change. But, should they? After all, we&rsquo;ve allowed some movies to be changed from how they were originally viewed. Traditionally, the Director&rsquo;s Cut accomplished this, but George Lucas infamously has successfully turned his movies inside out a few times over. That&rsquo;s quite something, particularly because Lucas seems to be looking for fights with his most dedicated fans.</p>
<p>However dumb the reasons, there are more than a few established ways to alter released movies. Books have second or third editions or even errata pages. Video games have online updates (if their developers are still around post-release). </p>
<p>Music, it seems, has been free from much significant updating. Or has it? Setting aside third-party covers or remixing (which make up a significant portion of music updates and create new value, IMO), songs get updated by an occasional remastering or, every once in a while, the original artist will perform the same song again with a different arrangement. I&rsquo;m not mad about that, I just don&rsquo;t see anybody doing what George Lucas has done. </p>
<p>One huge exception where music is reborn anew is live performance. In fact, I&rsquo;ve heard musicians talk in interviews how they really learned to play their song only after being on tour with it for a while. This is akin to how stand up comedy works: material is stretched and adjusted while timing and structure is experimented with. And, like Louis CK has become known for, one of the final performances is recorded and sold. Vaudeville and old-school Broadway operated like that, and it is a lot of work, but it&rsquo;s a great product at the other end.</p>
<p>Jonathan Coulton himself actually did this with his latest album, Artificial Heart. He toured for about a year before recording the thing with live musicians. And even then, he was playing with the texture of the song as the accompanists suggested. The performance was recorded very nearly in its prime.</p>
<p>I think that the notion of continual value may be a part of the bereft artist&rsquo;s bleak future. Maybe in the future, if the price of studio recording is lessened, your digital albums are so ubiquitous that you will not be tied to just one copy of a recorded song. Maybe the recording artist takes more money from you at the outset for the promise of legitimate new copies of any song updates that he records.</p>
<p>Or maybe music just wants to be recorded once and frozen in time, mistakes and all. And that alone creates the scarcity to bring your audience to see you live to get the real experience.</p>
