                                    <h1>Steaming up all the soft wares</h1>
                    <p>With the official <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/8584/">announcement</a> of Steam&rsquo;s dip into the non-gaming software ecosystem confirming the rumor we heard a few weeks ago, <a href="http://bitshift.tumblr.com/post/27144163561/will-steam-greenlight-change-gaming-for-good">the thing I said about Greenlight&rsquo;s potential for pollution</a> looks like a pretty tame worry. In comparison to the pitfall of a gimmicky list of games, the problem of narrowing down the best in quality of utility and productivity software looks like a Mt. Everest problem.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s a problem that can be and needs to be solved. It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s been hard for the existing PC software download stores to be very good about keeping the storefront relevant and the contents high quality. </p>
<p>Take NewEgg, for instance. Their <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Store/Category.aspx?Category=295&amp;name=Downloadable-Software">downloadable software storefront</a> has gone through many iterations and it seems to have improved a little since downloads were first introduced. But the vast majority of their software pushes has been all about boxed copies. So all that seems to be remaining is just a lot of Microsoft Office titles. It seems to me that any remaining customer base Office has after free online solutions like Google Docs sprung up would either be on a corporate license or wouldn&rsquo;t know that you can buy software outside of Best Buy.</p>
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/pc-mac-software-downloads/b/ref=sw_nav_top_asd?ie=UTF8&amp;node=1233514011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=0AQRYSF66JXA3D3FSPT1&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1376022922&amp;pf_rd_i=229534">downloads store</a> is arguably worse. Well, it has more selection (and it&rsquo;s Amazon, so they had better), but the content is a mixed bag of quality and relevance is maybe not very good straight away. That&rsquo;s surprising to me because I&rsquo;ve bought some software and hardware from Amazon in the past, including downloadable games. I&rsquo;d expect their recommendations to be over-my-shoulder prescient. I don&rsquo;t recall any time I was interested in guitar or piano lesson software, but maybe some of my normal product search history is affecting it.</p>
<p>So, improving relevance is a big deal. Steam ends up being pretty good at this purely because Valve is a recognized force in the gaming world. Their featured items aren&rsquo;t just &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s on sale.&rdquo; Depending upon how the marketing campaign goes, a featured item on Steam can tell the predominant gaming audience, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what you should buy. Oh, and it&rsquo;s only $11.49 each if you get a 4 pack.&rdquo; And gamers like me happily subject our wallets to that sort of torture, because we like the ecosystem very much.</p>
<p>Naturally, the big competition comes from the Mac App Store and the pending Windows App Store. Apple is doing it well enough that people are buying stuff, and the fear from Valve is that Microsoft could do it 1/8th as well and still make 20x the revenue. </p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s a hard sell for me on the sheer desirability of a lot of software. It&rsquo;s not super-tempting for me to see something like this:</p>
<p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="65" data-orig-width="400"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a290db7b110b3e601444e8f921faaca0/3c72696278758a58-02/s540x810/6368df1257217d98ab300a4b6e187a1ad2db6c96.jpg" data-orig-height="65" data-orig-width="400"/></figure></p>
<p>Without belaboring the point too much, Steam&rsquo;s Greenlight can help sift out the stupid ones (or it could hurt if it ends up being game-able). There should probably be a more software-friendly interface (at least less black, but just as minimal is fine) than the gaming side of Steam. And success will largely depend upon how willing the software devs and pubs are to give up their often premium prices every once in a while to hit the sweet spot of the Steam sales.</p>
<p>Valve says that gamers say they want their software to be on Steam. No doubt. Auto updates are somewhat important. But really, we just want to have a reason to spend $2.50 on Photoshop.</p>
