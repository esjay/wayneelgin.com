                    <p>Let Me Google that For You is familiar to many technically savvy people who are often pattered with simple requests that Google is much more sufficiently suited. Behind the snark the message is becoming more clear: &ldquo;You should be able to find everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which is yielding to, &ldquo;You should be able to learn and know anything, at least temporarily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But on the other side of that, what happens when folks are afraid to ask the dumb questions? Right now, somebody somewhere is forgetting to google something that they promised to look up when they had a moment instead of bothering a friend. Or, someone just googled something and came upon a niche forum where the potential answerer told the requestor to search it rather than sully the forum with a duplication of content (!!!).</p>
<p>Teaching a man to fish is great. But assuming that everyone should be a master fisherman&hellip; maybe is not the greatest thing, so much.</p>
