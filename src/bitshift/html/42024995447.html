                                    <h1>Hey nVidia, Want Project Shield to Compete? Open it Up</h1>
                    <p>As much as we all want to see a device like Project Shield change the way mobile gaming happens, binding it to your GeForce cards (while understandable from your market perspective), automatically cuts out AMD gamers from caring about the product. </p>
<p>And while there is a real appeal to getting PC-style gaming to happen on just one Android device, the actual Android side of the platform should be built out to support as many of the hardware-strong Android devices as possible (not just nVidia&rsquo;s hardware).</p>
<p>By doing so, nVidia would be allowing the Shield experience to be tasted and not just imagined. This is one reason why Apple Stores helped bolster so many hardware sales, actually. People unfamiliar with Apple devices and interface quality got a chance to get hands-on with it for the first times in their lives. </p>
<p>Since nVidia won&rsquo;t be able to justify an Apple Store presence with Project Shield (maybe a Best Buy and GameStop demo station will pop up, but how large a reach is that anymore?), it makes more sense to shop the experience to non-Shield devices as a marketing demo. Even if the devices aren&rsquo;t fully powerful, if some Steam games can stream over to their PC, it changes their mind about what an Android device can do.</p>
<p>Finally, if nVidia doesn&rsquo;t open Shield up, they are leaving a gaping wide gap for someone else to fill. Akin to the &ldquo;What happens if Google does it?&rdquo; argument that is used to test the mettle of tech startups, &ldquo;What happens if Valve does this?&rdquo; might apply here.</p>
<p>We already know that Valve has a hardware team working on a Steambox. Apparently, that will be an ultraportable gaming machine. It seems like an indirect competitor to Project Shield in and of itself. Instead of relying upon nVidia (who still doesn&rsquo;t have automatic driver distribution through Steam) to play nice with Valve via Project Shield, it seems Valve might rather provide its own companion controller/display for Steambox in the future. I mean, they have been selling the Razer Hydra via Steam for years already. And they have Michael Abrash looking at wearable displays and such. Tick tock.</p>
<p>Project Shield looks like a very standard portable gaming system (e.g. Nintendo&rsquo;s 3DS, Sony&rsquo;s PSP, Sega&rsquo;s GameGear?). So, given that the almighty GameBoy is succumbing to the pressures of the mobile gaming ecosystem, why start a portable gaming project right now? nVidia is betting, at least partially on openness. The existing Android ecosystem complements, rather than cannibalizes, the marketability of Project Shield. In addition, the renaissance of PC gaming since 2008 has sparked a renewed interest in highly discounted games vis a vis Steam and other stores. Walling a garden wouldn&rsquo;t make sense, but making a combine that can work both the Android garden and the Steam garden simultaneously makes a lot of sense.  As I measure it, Project Shield is unique in just two ways. The Android app that talks to Steam, and the fact that the GPU is linking to the Android app over a network.</p>
