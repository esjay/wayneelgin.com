                                    <h1>Worse: Bad Apps or Bad Ads?</h1>
                    <p>In a recent <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/fight-against-scam-adsby-numbers.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28Official+Google+Blog%29">post about ad quality</a>, Google notes that it&rsquo;s been rejecting an exponentially higher amount of ads than just a few years ago. If Google&rsquo;s primary product is advertising, as many people say, it&rsquo;s interesting to note the similarities between its ad policies and Apple&rsquo;s App Store policies. <br/><br/>Google cleanses its ads from scummy content or for sites that are not worthwhile (but apparently has no such system for its Android apps), and it does not basis ads on the basis of competition with itself or even trademarked search queries. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Apple routinely rejects its apps for poor quality (which is debatable, but probably a good thing) and also rejects any apps that provide competitive services or even features. As a point of reference, the fact that Apple did not reject the Opera browser app made headlines. </p>
<p>The anti-competitive stance for a platform controller like Apple is one of the biggest reasons that geeks like me find it hard to back iOS for the future. Most customers don&rsquo;t seem to mind (probably because they don&rsquo;t know to mind), but I&rsquo;m sticking with the freedom of choice that Android gives me, for now.</p>
