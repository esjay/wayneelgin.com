                    <p>Man, Games for Windows Live sucks. Lots of words have been assembled regarding the quantity of suck contained within Games for Windows Live, and by me even typing that, I&rsquo;ve made the newly biggest understatement of 2012 (the previous one was &ldquo;man, Dick Clark doesn&rsquo;t look so good&hellip;&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Finding someone with something good to say about GFWL is harder than finding someone to play with on GFWL. I thought it may be helpful to dive into exactly why Games for Windows Live is so reviled among PC gamers.</p>
<p>BioShock 2 is an interesting example. It employs both third-party DRM and GFWL. While the SecuROM DRM scheme has been scaled back to enjoy unlimited activations, the GFWL scheme it used only supported 15 total activations. While retailers like Amazon will provide as many keys as you need to circumvent these activation limits, Microsoft alone promises only 1 with proof of purchase (per the <a href="http://slickdeals.net/f/5375694-This-post-can-and-should-be-edited-by-users-like-you?p=54159604#edit54159604">BioShock 2 Slick Deals wiki</a>). 15 activations is a decent amount, but consider how many times a gamer may upgrade hardware in his lifetime and this just becomes an unnecessary frustrator. Even if the DRM actually prevented piracy, what&rsquo;s the point of so thoroughly protecting a game that has since gone on sale for less than $5?</p>
